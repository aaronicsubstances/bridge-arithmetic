## Cross Checking Techniques

The ability to cross-check answers becomes critical in the study of many science subjects in general. And especially in mathematics where there is usually only 1 right answer, starting with the study of algebra. As such, early algebra students must be introduced to the habit of cross-checking results using any strategy teachers, content areas, or test questions may provide for this purpose. Examples of such strategies are:

   - counting
   - geometry/space reference
   - proof by example
   - guess-and-check technique
   - sense making in natural language
   - making use of answer choices as educated guesses
   - making use of multiple ways of solving a problem for answer verification.
   - It helps to teach each arithmetic operation with both its inverse and repetition counterparts at a point, to add to cross-checking avenues.
   - The typical examination format of objective and theory question can include a third category like what some textbooks do, which is providing the desired full or partial answer for a theory question. 
   - And can also include a fourth category of requiring working (show working) for an objective question, just to force students to cross-check answers.

## Counteracting Misconceptions about evaluating mathematical expressions

BODMAS-like mnemonics must be discarded due to their incompleteness with nested brackets, potential for creating misconceptions, inflexibility, and the greater benefit of identifying the last rather than the first operation in algebraic expressions.

   - e.g. 3 - 2 + 1 is 2, not 0 as suggested b "addition before subtraction".
   - e.g. in 2 * 1 + 2 - 3, subtraction can be done first, or even simultaneously with multiplication. only the addition has to be done last.
   - Use only brackets in arithmetic and early algebra, and postpone algebraic language and its conventions as used in the mathematics community until formal algebra study.

Since the properties of commutativity, associativity and distributivity together form the basis for the manipulation rules in algebra, 
then any misconception which will make it harder for early algebra students to accept these properties later on must be identified and cured or prevented. 
In general, the earlier a misconception in algebra can be addressed in early algebra, the better. Examples are:
    
   - similarity between letter 'x' and multiplication cross symbol - fix by bracketing use of letter 'x' in formal algebra study and ensuring surrounding spaces around multiplication cross symbol for as long as possible. e.g ax*b+x becomes a(x) * b + (x) 
   - interpreting concatenation of letters always as single word, and not considering possibility that function application or multiplication may be involved. 
       - fix by inserting separating brackets in between single letter labels occuring in concatenations in formal algebra study, for as long as possible. e.g. ax + b becomes a(x) + b. abcd + ef + 2g becomes a(b)c(d) + e(f) + 2g.
       - Also never use a word or label in early algebra which begins with a number, plus or minus sign.
   - that the only real number is the counting number - fix with examples whose inputs are counting numbers, but ouput becomes fraction, e.g. with division
   - evaluation of algebraic expressions follows natural language reading from left to right - fix with examples like 2 + (5 * 3)
   - subtraction and division are commutative - fix with questions whose answer is undefined like 2 - 4, 4 / 0, as well as give division questions with different results, such as 4 / 3 = 1 r 1 or 1 1/3 whereas 3 / 4 = 0 r 3 or 3/4.
   - order of operations doesn't matter - fix by accepting undefined for arithmetic expressions which can result in more than 1 answer, and which cannot be evaluated using knowledge of parenthesis precedence and commutativity of addition and multiplication alone. E.g. 2 * 3 * 3 and 2 + (3 * 4) cannot be undefined, but 2 + 3 * 4 and 2 * 3 + 4 can be (i.e. either supply undefined or get the correct answer somehow).
   - equal sign always mean compute - fix with equation solving
   - answers always have to be numbers, or even counting numbers - fix with generation of mathematical expressions.
   - the rule of "brackets first" cannot be overriden, when sometimes distributive law makes it possible to override - fix  by teaching grid method of multiplication.

## Ignorance Points (which may lead to misconceptions)

   - not enough to do arithmetic by counting, but that one needs to be fast and accurate about it using non-counting techniques.
   - not enough to do arithmetic in the head, but that reality of multi-step arithmetic means leveraging writing to record temporary results.
   - cannot afford to skip cross check solutions given the need for "only 1 right answer in mathematics" and the role mathematics plays in determining advancement
      in level of education. The student should then appreciate and adopt as many cross checking avenues as possible.
   - mathematics does not always correspond to the real and practical world of the student, and so student must accept and get used to its abstract and theoretical aspects.
   - all evaluations of mathematics expressions must produce one right answer, and so it is not up to student to determine the order of operations.

## Curriculum Design Tips

   1. Developing proficiency in arithmetic.
       - An alternative to compulsory memorization of time table, is to make the tables available to them during exercises and exams, but give them complex multi-step arithmetic exercises, such that the students themselves realize the need to memorize some parts of the time table due to the frequent lookups.
       - Can teach a first phase of fractions arithmetic in which fractions have the same denominators, there is no multiplication, and division of fractions taught as equivalent to whole number division.
       - Ensure early algebra students can compare any two positive real numbers to determine which is greater, or arrange on number line in correct order.

   2. Design of alternative mathematics expressions based on parse trees.
       - Can consider using "upside-down" trees in which the root is the bottommost node, to resemble top-down presentation of math solution.
       - the nodes of the parse tree will be labels (operator symbols, variables, functions or expressions) which are underlined or not.
       - Parse tree does not have to be a connected tree, so as to enable use of temporary variables which can be used multiple times, or not at all.
       - underlined labels merely serve as labels of subtrees when traversing a tree to derive its label. As such can only have one child.
       - ellipsis can be used in an underlined label to indicate where to include a subtree label. e.g. (...) means bracket the label from the singleton child subtree.
       - labels which are not underlined are algebraic expressions, in which known function and variable names will be given priority over concatenation.
       - if a function application is the only constituent of an non-underlined label, then the parenthesis and parameters can be excluded. Else the parameters
          must match the labels from its subtrees.
       - underlining can be omitted if some conventions or context can be leveraged to deal with the resulting ambiguities of not underlining.
       - in general, present overloaded operations as functions throughout early algebra.
       - disallow function names which resemble algebraic expressions but are defined differently than the name suggests. In other words, a function named as an algebraic expression, has to be defined exactly with that expression.
       - allow functions to be specified with tables, conditionals and recursion.
       - introduce a set of functions with consistent names, which will serve as baseline/reference for implicit mathematics operations later on.

   3. Curricular activities for applying mathematics in the real world.
       - susu-box management
       - cash-based accounting
       - sports league standings
       - cooking recipes
       - distance measurement, including anatomy-based (inch, foot, yard)
       - weight/mass measurement, including balances/scales used throughout history.
       - wall clock readings
       - descriptive statistics
       - sharing money in ratios (determining whether I received correct amount).
       - picking largest of 2 or more fractions
  
   4. Ways of adopting textbook "forward-only" exercises for early algebra.
       - Can adapt for generalization by re-asking the question with large counting numbers, non-counting numbers and unknown numbers.
       - Can adapt for equation solving by "reversing the question".

   5. Functions to develop
       - LCM - use method of addition rather than multiplication to populate sets of multiples of 2 or more arguments.
       - "of" operator (or "enlarge" or "resize" functions).
           - So if 3 Ã— 4 is read "3 times of 4" (or just "3 times 4"), ie what is triple of 4?, then we can also say "3 of 4", and mean "resize 4 by a factor of 3". And this can lead to use of factors which are not whole numbers but are positive rational numbers, such as in "1/2 of 6" which means "resize 6 by factor of 1/2", ie what is half of 6?
           - can be leveraged later to present multiplication beyond whole number arithmetic as something generally different from repeated addition.
       - create fraction and simplify (given a numerator and a denominator) - can be leveraged later to present division beyond whole number arithmetic as a fraction-creation operation.
       - modulo or remainder
       - square
       - cube
       - absolute value or magnitude
       - sign
       - negation
       - reciprocal
       - real number comparison
       - real number subtraction
       - real number multiplication
       - real number division


   6. Number theory concepts and their level of relevance in basic school
       - Divisibility rules - crucially important, esp for 2, 3, 5, 10. Practically 3 and 7 are the "troublesome" single digit primes, but even then given the simplicity of the rule for 3 and knowing about few powers of 7 (ie 49 and 343) is sufficient in practice for almost all fraction simplification needs.
       - Even and odd numbers - crucially important for determining divisibility by 2.
       - Squares and cubes, square roots and cube roots - crucially important to know the values for squares of whole numbers up to 20, and cubes of the single digits.
       - LCM - useful in practice, although it can be substituted by common multiples (CM).
       - Equivalence of fractions (in decimal or non decimal formats) - very relevant as an alternative to simplifying fractions to relative primes.
       - HCF, generating all factors of a number, and prime numbers - Doesn't seem to be used directly in practice; instead common factors (CF) are rather used.
