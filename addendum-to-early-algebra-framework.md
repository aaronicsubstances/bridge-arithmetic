## Cross Checking Techniques

The ability to cross-check answers becomes critical in the study of many science subjects in general. And especially in mathematics where there is usually only 1 right answer, starting with the study of algebra. As such, early algebra students must be introduced to the habit of cross-checking results using any strategy teachers, content areas, or test questions may provide for this purpose. Examples of such strategies are:

- counting
- geometry/space reference
- proof by example
- guess-and-check technique
- sense making in natural language
- making use of answer choices as educated guesses
- making use of multiple ways of solving a problem for answer verification.
- It helps to teach each arithmetic operation with both its inverse and repetition counterparts at a point, to add to cross-checking avenues.
- The typical examination format of objective and theory question can include a third category like what some textbooks do, which is providing the desired full or partial answer for a theory question.
- And can also include a fourth category of requiring working (show working) for an objective question, just to force students to cross-check answers.

## Curriculum Design Tips

1. Can introduce the abacus device for addition as precursor to the standard addition procedure.

2. Can modify standard multiplication procedure to be more intuitive by fillng the bottom right hand spaces with zeros, and introducing the '+' sign to indicate the final addition. Note also that this multiplication procedure is an application of the distributive property of multiplication over addition.

3. Can modify standard long division procedure to be easier to recall, by placing a digit on top of each digit of the dividend. In the case of long division beyond the decimal places available in the dividend, manually add a zero (preceded by adding  a decimal point if necessary) to the dividend, for each digit in the partial quotient answer generated after the decimal point. Overall, this means that the modification is meant to ensure a one-to-one correspondence between the digits and optional decimal point of the dividend, and the digits and optional decimal point of the quotient answer above it.

4. If misconceptions about commutativity of the four basic arithmetic operations prove too enduring to be rooted out by proficiency in arithmetic of non-whole numbers alone, then these exercises may be employed in experiments to try forestalling the misconceptions:
   - asking subtraction questions in which result can be negative, and accepting "undefined", "unexpected number", "negative",
    or actual negative result as valid answers, to show that subtraction is not commutative even before teaching integer arithmetic.
   - asking division questions in which there is division by zero and division which yields zero, and accepting "undefined" as possible result.
   - asking division questions in which quotient can be zero, to show that division is not commutative before teaching fractions.
   - exposing students to calculations involving number zero in operands or answers, before and after teaching integers and fractions.

6. Leverage simplification of fractions for several benefits, including getting students to notice structures related to multiplication,
   division, factors, multiples, and divisors.
   - Students can see pictorially what simplification of fractions is.
   - Serves as counterpart to simplification of algebraic expressions in the future.

7. Curricular activities for applying mathematics in the real world.

   - use ruler and compass only to perform rational number arithmetic, through 2D vector addition, flipping and scaling with right-angled triangles.
   - susu-box (aka piggy bank) management
   - cash-based accounting
   - sports league standings
   - cooking recipes
   - distance measurement, including anatomy-based (inch, foot, yard)
   - weight/mass measurement, including balances/scales used throughout history.
   - wall clock readings
   - descriptive statistics
   - sharing money in ratios (determining whether I received correct amount).
   - picking largest of large whole numbers or fractions, representing monetary amounts or physical quantities
   - integer division from partition perspective - sharing money without bias for any recipient (hence a common quotient) or cheating by distributor (hence remainder must be smaller than divisor).

8. Ways of adopting textbook "forward-only" exercises for early algebra.

   - Can adapt for generalization by re-asking the question with large whole numbers, non-whole numbers and unknown numbers.
   - Can adapt for equation solving by "reversing the question".

9. Introduce enough variety of arithmetic expression evaluation exercises in order to avoid using BODMAS mnemonic in unintended situations. Note also that they end up demonstrating associativity of addition and multiplication.

10. HCF and LCM do not seem to be used directly in practice; instead common factors (CF) and common multiples (CM) are used.

11. Quadratic factorization
    - instead of looking for factors of ac which add up to b, can rather teach almighty formula and use product of roots by -a as the desired factors.
    - as a help to quadratic factorization in algebra, can train students to identify coefficients of linear and quadratic expressions and equations in early algebra.

## Explanation for Fraction Procedures

### Addition and Subtraction

1. To add or subtract fractions, get the denominators to be the same, and then add or subtract the numerators.
2. So in general when denominators are not the same, cross multiplication technique is used to make the denominators the same.
3. So a/b &plusmn; c/d = (a &times; d)/(b &times; d) &plusmn; (b &times; c)/(b &times; d) = (a &times; d &plusmn; b &times; c)/(b &times; d)

### Comparison

1. As is the case for all numbers, to compare a/b and c/d, compute a/b &minus; c/d and check the sign by comparing with zero.
2. The general result for subtraction gives (a &times; d &minus; b &times; c)/(b &times; d)
3. After ensuring b and d are positive, and because the subtraction result is being compared with zero,
the sign of the subtraction result can be completely determined by the sign of the numerator alone: (a &times; d &minus; b &times; c).
4. And since that numerator is a subtraction expression, we can interpret it as a comparison between (a &times; d) and (b &times; c)

### Multiplication

1. Multiplication of fractions a/b and c/d can be defined as solving the following problem involving ratios:
find a fraction x such that x &ratio; c/d = a &ratio; b, and x &ratio; a/b = c &ratio; d
1. And the solution, which is a result of how division of fractions is defined, is x = (a &times; c)/(b &times; d)
2. It happens that (a &times; c)/(b &times; d) = a &times; (c/d &div; b), which is the definition of a/b of c/d
3. Hence a/b of c/d = a/b &times; c/d = (a &times; c)/(b &times; d)

### Division

1. Division of fractions takes advantage of the fact that a positive fraction is equivalent to a ratio between the numerator and the denominator
2. Division of fractions (whether simple or non-simple) is defined as being equivalent to creating a ratio from the operands, even if the operands are fractions or negative.
3. So a/b &div; c/d = a/b &ratio; c/d
2. Multiplying through the ratio by b results in: a &ratio; b &times; c/d
2. Multiplying through the ratio by d results in: a &times; d &ratio; b &times; c
3. Converting the ratio back to fraction yields: (a &times; d) &ratio; (b &times; c) = (a &times; d)/(b &times; c)
3. If there are non-simple fractions involved, then the multiplications in the formula will involve divisions, which can in turn lead to
multiplication of fractions and a cycle of performing multiplications and divisions of fractions will occur. However the cycle will end
because the fractions in each step will be decreasing in complexity, until simple fractions are encountered, or until the following are encountered:
   - having a multiplication in which there is a whole number operand. Cycle ends since multiplication of whole numbers (by repeated addition) can then be used.
   - having a division in which the second operand is a whole number. Cycle ends since multiplication (to get equivalent fraction) and division of whole numbers can then be used.
