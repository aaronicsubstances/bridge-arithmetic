## Cross Checking Techniques

The ability to cross-check answers becomes critical in the study of many science subjects in general. And especially in mathematics where there is usually only 1 right answer, starting with the study of algebra. As such, early algebra students must be introduced to the habit of cross-checking results using any strategy teachers, content areas, or test questions may provide for this purpose. Examples of such strategies are:

  - counting
  - geometry/space reference
  - proof by example
  - guess-and-check technique
  - sense making in natural language
  - making use of answer choices as educated guesses
  - making use of multiple ways of solving a problem for answer verification.
  - It helps to teach each arithmetic operation with both its inverse and repetition counterparts at a point, to add to cross-checking avenues.
  - The typical examination format of objective and theory question can include a third category like what some textbooks do, which is providing the desired full or partial answer for a theory question. 
  - And can also include a fourth category of requiring working (show working) for an objective question, just to force students to cross-check answers.

## Curriculum Design Tips

  1. Can introduce the abacus device for addition and subtraction as precursor to the standard addition and subtraction algorithms.

  1. Can teach grid multiplication method and chunk division methods as precursors to the standard multiplication and long division algorithms.
     - They make direct use of the definitions of multiplication and division, thus enforcing the definitions of the arithmetic operations.
     - They enforce deeper understanding of place value, and hence the naming and comparison of numbers.
     - Grid multiplication exposes students to the distributive property, which is the basis of expansion and factorization techniques in algebra.
     - Chunking method of division can be used for generating approximate terminating decimal expansions to any number of desired decimal places.

  2. Can teach students to make use of their fingers and scrach pads to master the arithmetic tables involving single digit numbers, especially multiplication tables, as precursor to memorization of the tables.
     - Given the difficulty and critical importance of the multiplication tables for multiplication and division, students should be introduced to them in parts rather than at once.
     - Begin with parts of the times table with products less than or equal to 20, and encourage the students to use their fingers (and segments of fingers if feasible), and leverage commutativity by using smaller operand as multiplier.
     - Next introduce 5, 10 and 11 times table (up to 10) due to their simplicity.
     - Can then introduce graphical "divide-and-conquer" technique (e.g. divide grid representing desired product into four quadrants) for computing the remaining products contained in the 6, 7, 8 and 9 times tables.
     - Present integer division as sharing money without bias for any recipient (hence a common quotient) or cheating by distributor (hence remainder must be smaller than divisor).

  3. Can teach "duplicate and divide" approach as precursor to the standard fraction arithmetic algorithms.
     - This approach presumes that it is straightforward to
        - perform comparison, addition or subtraction of fractions when the operands have the same denominator, or when at least one of the operands is a whole number.
        - simplify a complex fraction (ie numerator or denominator is not a whole number) by multiplication.
     - So all one has to do is to leverage the sameness of denominators or duplicate the operands until at least one of the operands becomes a whole number, compare/add/subtract/divide, optionally divide by duplicate count, and simplify any complex fraction result by multiplication.
     - This alternative approach has the convenient feature that it can be demonstrated pictorially to mathematics novices.
 
  4. Leverage simplification of fractions for several benefits, including getting students to notice structures related to multiplication,
division, factors, multiples, and divisors.
     - Students can see pictorially what simplification of fractions is.
     - Serves as counterpart to simplification of algebraic expressions in the future.

  4. Curricular activities for applying mathematics in the real world.
     - susu-box management
     - cash-based accounting
     - sports league standings
     - cooking recipes
     - distance measurement, including anatomy-based (inch, foot, yard)
     - weight/mass measurement, including balances/scales used throughout history.
     - wall clock readings
     - descriptive statistics
     - sharing money in ratios (determining whether I received correct amount).
     - picking largest of large counting numbers or fractions, representing monetary amounts or physical quantities
  
  4. Ways of adopting textbook "forward-only" exercises for early algebra.
     - Can adapt for generalization by re-asking the question with large counting numbers, non-counting numbers and unknown numbers.
     - Can adapt for equation solving by "reversing the question".
  
  3. Introduce enough variety of arithmetic expression evaluation exercises in order to avoid using BODMAS mnemonic in unintended situations.

  4. It is important to teach balance model with cross checking during equation solving, so that students will be able to avoid using the model in unintended situations.

  5. Number theory concepts and their level of relevance in basic school
     - Divisibility rules - crucially important, esp for 2, 3, 5, 10. Practically 3 and 7 are the "troublesome" single digit primes, but even then given the simplicity of the rule for 3 and knowing about few powers of 7 (ie 49 and 343) is sufficient in practice for almost all fraction simplification needs.
     - Even and odd numbers - crucially important for determining divisibility by 2.
     - Squares and cubes, square roots and cube roots - crucially important to know the values for squares of whole numbers up to 20, and cubes of the single digits.
     - LCM - useful in practice, although it can be substituted by common multiples (CM).
     - HCF, generating all factors of a number, and prime numbers - Doesn't seem to be used directly in practice; instead common factors (CF) are rather used.
