## Cross Checking Techniques

The ability to cross-check answers becomes critical in the study of many science subjects in general. And especially in mathematics where there is usually only 1 right answer, starting with the study of algebra. As such, early algebra students must be introduced to the habit of cross-checking results using any strategy teachers, content areas, or test questions may provide for this purpose. Examples of such strategies are:

  - counting
  - geometry/space reference
  - proof by example
  - guess-and-check technique
  - sense making in natural language
  - making use of answer choices as educated guesses
  - making use of multiple ways of solving a problem for answer verification.
  - It helps to teach each arithmetic operation with both its inverse and repetition counterparts at a point, to add to cross-checking avenues.
  - The typical examination format of objective and theory question can include a third category like what some textbooks do, which is providing the desired full or partial answer for a theory question. 
  - And can also include a fourth category of requiring working (show working) for an objective question, just to force students to cross-check answers.

## Curriculum Design Tips

  1. Teach grid multiplication method and chunk division methods before standard multiplication and long division algorithms.
     - They make direct use of the definitions of multiplication and division, thus enforcing the definitions of the arithmetic operations.
     - They can serve as baseline/reference algorithms for their non-intuitive but faster counterparts, and even allow the latter to be taught later on as part of algebra.
     - They enforce deeper understanding of place value, and hence the naming and comparison of numbers.
     - Grid multiplication exposes students to the distributive property, which is the basis of expansion and factorization techniques in algebra.
     - Chunking method of division can be used for generating approximate terminating decimal expansions to any number of desired decimal places.

  2. Teach students to make use of their fingers and memory to master the arithmetic tables involving single digit numbers, especially multiplication tables, in the hope that they will eventually memorize the tables.
     - Given the difficulty and critical importance of the multiplication tables for multiplication and division, students should be introduced to them in parts rather than at once.
     - Begin with parts of the times table with products less than or equal to 20, and the 5 times table (up to 9), and encourage the students to use their fingers (and segments of fingers, and toes if feasible), and use smaller operand as multiplier.
     - Next introduce 10 and 11 times table (up to 10) due to their simplicity.
     - Can then introduce graphical "divide-and-conquer grid" technique (e.g. divide into two halves or four quadrants), as precursor to grid or standard multiplication algorithm, in which operands are small enough so that distributive property and multiplication tables can be applied, even for computing 6, 7, 8 and 9 times tables.
     - Present integer division as sharing money without bias (hence a common quotient) or cheating (hence remainder must be smaller than divisor).

  3. Teach alternative to fraction arithmetic without LCMs, HCFs, equivalent fractions and prime numbers.
     - Inspired by [Anita's way of adding fractions with different denominators](http://mathpractices.edc.org/pdf/Anitas_Way_to_Add_Fractions_with_Unlike_Denominators.pdf).
     - Can serve as reference for standard fraction arithmetic algorithms.
     - This approach presumes that it is straightforward to
        - perform comparison, addition or subtraction of fractions when one of the operands is a whole number.
        - simplify a complex fraction (ie numerator or denominator is a fraction) by multiplication.
     - So all one has to do is to duplicate at least one of the operands till it becomes a whole number, compare/add/subtract/divide, optionally divide by duplicate count, and simplify any complex fraction result by multiplication.
     - This alternative approach has the convenient feature that it can be demonstrated pictorially to mathematics novices.

  4. Curricular activities for applying mathematics in the real world.
     - susu-box management
     - cash-based accounting
     - sports league standings
     - cooking recipes
     - distance measurement, including anatomy-based (inch, foot, yard)
     - weight/mass measurement, including balances/scales used throughout history.
     - wall clock readings
     - descriptive statistics
     - sharing money in ratios (determining whether I received correct amount).
     - picking largest of 2 or more fractions
  
  4. Ways of adopting textbook "forward-only" exercises for early algebra.
     - Can adapt for generalization by re-asking the question with large counting numbers, non-counting numbers and unknown numbers.
     - Can adapt for equation solving by "reversing the question".

  4. Functions to develop
     - LCM - use method of addition rather than multiplication to populate sets of multiples of 2 or more arguments.
     - "of" operator (or "enlarge" or "resize" functions)
     - create fraction and simplify (given a numerator and a denominator) - can be leveraged later to present division beyond whole number arithmetic as a fraction-creation operation.
     - modulo or remainder
     - absolute value or magnitude
     - sign
     - exp
     - square
     - cube
     - nth-root
     - square root
     - cube root
     - reciprocal
     - negation
     - real number comparison
     - real number subtraction
     - real number multiplication
     - real number division

  5. Number theory concepts and their level of relevance in basic school
     - Divisibility rules - crucially important, esp for 2, 3, 5, 10. Practically 3 and 7 are the "troublesome" single digit primes, but even then given the simplicity of the rule for 3 and knowing about few powers of 7 (ie 49 and 343) is sufficient in practice for almost all fraction simplification needs.
     - Even and odd numbers - crucially important for determining divisibility by 2.
     - Squares and cubes, square roots and cube roots - crucially important to know the values for squares of whole numbers up to 20, and cubes of the single digits.
     - LCM - useful in practice, although it can be substituted by common multiples (CM).
     - Equivalence of fractions (in decimal or non decimal formats) - very relevant as an alternative to simplifying fractions to relative primes.
     - HCF, generating all factors of a number, and prime numbers - Doesn't seem to be used directly in practice; instead common factors (CF) are rather used.
