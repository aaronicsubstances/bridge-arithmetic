## Cross Checking Techniques

The ability to cross-check answers becomes critical in the study of many science subjects in general. And especially in mathematics where there is usually only 1 right answer, starting with the study of algebra. As such, early algebra students must be introduced to the habit of cross-checking results using any strategy teachers, content areas, or test questions may provide for this purpose. Examples of such strategies are:

- counting
- geometry/space reference
- proof by example
- guess-and-check technique
- sense making in natural language
- making use of answer choices as educated guesses
- making use of multiple ways of solving a problem for answer verification.
- It helps to teach each arithmetic operation with both its inverse and repetition counterparts at a point, to add to cross-checking avenues.
- The typical examination format of objective and theory question can include a third category like what some textbooks do, which is providing the desired full or partial answer for a theory question.
- And can also include a fourth category of requiring working (show working) for an objective question, just to force students to cross-check answers.

## Curriculum Design Tips

1. Can introduce the abacus device for addition as precursor to the standard addition algorithm.

2. Can modify standard multiplication algorithm to be more intuitive by fillng the bottom right hand spaces with zeros, and introducing the '+' sign to indicate the final addition.

6. Leverage simplification of fractions for several benefits, including getting students to notice structures related to multiplication,
   division, factors, multiples, and divisors.
   - Students can see pictorially what simplification of fractions is.
   - Serves as counterpart to simplification of algebraic expressions in the future.

7. Curricular activities for applying mathematics in the real world.

   - use ruler and compass only to perform rational number arithmetic, through 2D vector addition, flipping and scaling with right-angled triangles.
   - susu-box (aka piggy bank) management
   - cash-based accounting
   - sports league standings
   - cooking recipes
   - distance measurement, including anatomy-based (inch, foot, yard)
   - weight/mass measurement, including balances/scales used throughout history.
   - wall clock readings
   - descriptive statistics
   - sharing money in ratios (determining whether I received correct amount).
   - picking largest of large whole numbers or fractions, representing monetary amounts or physical quantities
   - integer division from partition perspective - sharing money without bias for any recipient (hence a common quotient) or cheating by distributor (hence remainder must be smaller than divisor).

8. Ways of adopting textbook "forward-only" exercises for early algebra.

   - Can adapt for generalization by re-asking the question with large whole numbers, non-whole numbers and unknown numbers.
   - Can adapt for equation solving by "reversing the question".

9. Introduce enough variety of arithmetic expression evaluation exercises in order to avoid using BODMAS mnemonic in unintended situations.

10. HCF, LCM, generating all factors of a number do not seem to be used directly in practice; instead common factors (CF) and common multiples (CM) are used.

11. Quadratic factorization
    - instead of looking for factors of ac which add up to b, can rather teach almighty formula and use product of roots by -a as the desired factors.
    - as a help to quadratic factorization in algebra, can train students to identify coefficients of linear and quadratic expressions and equations in early algebra.
