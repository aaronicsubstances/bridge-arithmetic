## Divisibility Rules
*Divisibility* of a number by another number means that when the first number is divided by the second number,
no remainder will be left. In that case the first number is said to be *divisible* by the second number.
The purpose of divisibility rules is to be able to avoid having to perform an actual division to determine whether
a number can be divided by another number without leaving a remainder in certain situations.
An important use of such rules is in the simplification of fractions.
Note that these rules are meant to be used together with multiplication tables and table of factorizations, to determine
divisibility without having to perform a division.

### Dividing with 2
A number is divisible by 2 if and only if its last digit is divisible by 2. In other words,
          if a number can be divided by 2 without leaving a remainder, then it has to mean that its last digit is
          one of 0, 2, 4, 6 or 8.

E.g. Out of the numbers 43, 58, 75, 90, 1027 and 2934; it is 58, 90 and 2934 that are divisible by 2, because their last digits
          are 8, 0 and 4 respectively.

NB: If a number is divisible by 2 it is called an *even* number; else it is called an *odd* number

### Dividing with 3
A number is divisible by 3 if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. In other words,
          if a number can be divided by 3 without leaving a remainder, then it has to mean that when you add its digits together, you will
          get a number which is divisible by 3. And you can repeat the rule on each successive sum of digits obtained, until you get one of the multiples of 3
          in the multiplication table, or until you get a single digit which will be 0, 3, 6 or 9 if and only if the starting number is
          divisible by 3.

E.g. Out of the numbers 24, 43, 58, 75, 90, 1027 and 2934; it is 24, 75, 90 and 2934 that are divisible by 3.
          <ol>
            <li>Taking 24, 2 + 4 = 6; and so getting 6 means 24 is divisible by 3
            (could have avoided test by recognizing that 24 is a known multiple of 3)</li>
            <li>Taking 43, 4 + 3 = 7, which is not 0, 3, 6 or 9; so 43 is not divisible by 3</li>
            <li>Taking 58, 5 + 8 = 13. Then taking 13, 1 + 3 = 4, which is not 0, 3, 6 or 9; so 58 is not divisible by 3
            (could have stopped test upon getting sum of 13)</li>
            <li>Taking 75, 7 + 5 = 12. Then taking 12, 1 + 2 = 3; and so getting 3 means 75 is divisible by 3
            (could have stopped test upon getting sum of 12)</li>
            <li>Taking 90, 9 + 0 = 9; and so getting 9 means 90 is divisible by 3
            (could have avoided test by ignoring the trailing zeros, and recognizing that 9 is a known multiple of 3)</li>
            <li>Taking 1027, 1 + 0 + 2 + 7 = 10, which is known not to be a multiple of 3; so 1027 is not divisible by 3</li>
            <li>Taking 2934, 2 + 9 + 3 + 4 = 18, which is a known multiple of 3; so 2934 is divisible by 3</li>
          </ol>

### Dividing with 5
A number is divisible by 5 if and only if its last digit is divisible by 5. In other words,
          if a number can be divided by 5 without leaving a remainder, then it has to mean that its last digit is either 0 or 5.

E.g. Out of the numbers 43, 58, 75, 90, 1027 and 2934; it is 75 and 90 that are divisible by 5, because their last digits
          are 5 and 0 respectively.

### Dividing with 7
A number is divisible by 7 if and only if the difference between double of its last digit and the rest is divisible by 7. In other words,
          if a number can be divided by 7 without leaving a remainder, then it has to mean that when you subtract double of its last digit from the number
          formed by the remaining digits (or subtract the other way round to avoid negatives), you will
          get a number which is divisible by 7. And you can repeat the rule on each successive difference obtained, until you get one of the multiples of 7
          in the multiplication table, or until you get a single digit which will be 0 or 7 if and only if the starting number is
          divisible by 7.

E.g. Out of the numbers 42, 58, 77, 161, 187 and 343; it is 42, 77, 161 and 343 that are divisible by 7.
          <ol>
            <li>Taking 42, 4 - (2 &times; 2) = 0; so 42 is divisible by 7
            (could have avoided test by recognizing that 42 is a known multiple of 7)</li>
            <li>Taking 58, (2 &times; 8) - 5 = 11; Then taking 11, (2 &times; 1) - 1 = 1, which is not 0 or 7; so 58 is not divisible by 7
            (could have stopped test upon getting difference of 11, or could have avoided test altogether by recognizing that 58 is known not
            to be a multiple of 7)</li>
            <li>Taking 77, (2 &times; 7) - 7 = 7; so 77 is divisible by 7
            (could have avoided test by recognizing that 77 is a known multiple of 7)</li>
            <li>Taking 161, 16 - (2 &times; 1) = 14; Then taking 14, (2 &times; 4) - 1 = 7; so 161 is divisible by 7
            (could have stopped test upon getting difference of 14)</li>
            <li>Taking 187, 18 - (2 &times; 7) = 4, which is not 0 or 7; so 187 is not divisible by 7</li>
            <li>Taking 343, 34 - (2 &times; 3) = 28, which is a known multiple of 7; so 343 is divisible by 7
            (could have avoided test by recognizing that 343 is the cube of 7)</li>
          </ol>

### Dividing with 9
A number is divisible by 9 if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9. In other words,
          if a number can be divided by 9 without leaving a remainder, then it has to mean that when you add its digits together, you will
          get a number which is divisible by 9. And you can repeat the rule on each successive sum of digits obtained, until you get one of the multiples of 9
          in the multiplication table, or until you get a single digit which will be 0 or 9 if and only if the starting number is
          divisible by 9.

E.g. Out of the numbers 43, 58, 75, 90, 1027 and 2934; it is 90 and 2934 that are divisible by 9.
          <ol>
            <li>Taking 43, 4 + 3 = 7, which is not 0 or 9; so 43 is not divisible by 9
            (could have avoided test by recognizing that 43 is known not to be a multiple of 9)</li>
            <li>Taking 58, 5 + 8 = 13. Then taking 13, 1 + 3 = 4, which is not 0 or 9; so 58 is not divisible by 9
            (could have stopped test upon getting sum of 13, or could have avoided test altogether by recognizing that
            58 is known not to be a multiple of 9)</li>
            <li>Taking 75, 7 + 5 = 12. Then taking 12, 1 + 2 = 3, which is not 0 or 9; so 75 is not divisible by 9
            (could have stopped test upon getting sum of 12, or could have avoided test altogether by recognizing that
            75 is known not to be a multiple of 9)</li>
            <li>Taking 90, 9 + 0 = 9; and so getting 9 means 90 is divisible by 9 (could have avoided test by recognizing
          that 90 is a known multiple of 9)</li>
            <li>Taking 1027, 1 + 0 + 2 + 7 = 10, which is known not to be a multiple of 9; so 1027 is not divisible by 9</li>
            <li>Taking 2934, 2 + 9 + 3 + 4 = 18, which is a known multiple of 9; so 2934 is divisible by 9</li>
          </ol>

### Dividing with 10
A number is divisible by 10 if and only if its last digit is 0.

E.g. Out of the numbers 43, 58, 75, 90, 1027 and 2934; it is 90 that is divisible by 10, because its last digit
          is 0.

NB: This rule can be generalized to any power of 10, ie a number which is 1 followed by zeros, e.g. 10, 100, 1000: 
          A number is divisible by a power of 10 if and only if there are enough trailing zeros in
          the number to cancel out the zeros in the power of 10.
### Dividing with 11
A number is divisible by 11 if and only if the difference between its last digit and the rest is divisible by 11. In other words,
          if a number can be divided by 11 without leaving a remainder, then it has to mean that when you subtract its last digit from the number
          formed by the remaining digits (or subtract the other way round to avoid negatives), you will
          get a number which is divisible by 11. And you can repeat the rule on each successive difference obtained, until you get one of the multiples of 11
          in the multiplication table, or until you get a single digit which will be 0 if and only if the starting number is
          divisible by 11.

E.g. Out of the numbers 42, 58, 77, 161, 187 and 343; it is 77 and 187 that are divisible by 11.
          <ol>
            <li>Taking 42, 4 - 2 = 2, which is not 0; so 42 is not divisible by 11
            (could have avoided test by recognizing that 42 is known not to be a multiple of 11)</li>
            <li>Taking 58, 8 - 5 = 3, which is not 0; so 58 is not divisible by 11
            (could have avoided test by recognizing that 58 is known not to be a multiple of 11)</li>
            <li>Taking 77, 7 - 7 = 0; so 77 is divisible by 11
            (could have avoided test by recognizing that 77 is a known multiple of 11)</li>
            <li>Taking 161, 16 - 1 = 15; Then taking 15, 5 - 1 = 4, which is not 0; so 161 is not divisible by 11
            (could have stopped test upon getting difference of 15)</li>
            <li>Taking 187, 18 - 7 = 11, which is a known multiple of 11; so 187 is divisible by 11</li>
            <li>Taking 343, 34 - 3 = 31, which is known not to be a multiple of 11; so 343 is not divisible by 11</li>
          </ol>


## Rule for Testing whether a Number in 1-200 is Prime or Composite
A *prime number* is a number greater than 1 that is not divisible by any number apart from itself and 1.
The first 10 prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23 and 29.
If a number is greater than 1 and is not a prime number, then it is a called a *composite number*.

A sufficient test for determining whether a number in the range of 12-200 is prime or composite, is this:
If a number between 12 and 200 is not 169 (which is a perfect square whose square root is 13)
and is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7 and 11 (which are the first 5 prime numbers),
then the number is definitely a prime number.
Else the number is definitely a composite number.

## Tables for Factorisations of 1-100
NB: In the table below, <ol>
<li>The numbers 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9 and any number whose last digit is 1, 3, 5, 7 or 9, have the additional description of odd numbers</li>
<li>The numbers 2, 4, 6 and 8 and any number whose last digit is 2, 4, 6, 8 or 0, have the additional description of even numbers</li>
<li>Multiples for numbers less than 13 are not listed because they can be found in the multiplication tables.</li>

## Integer and Signed Number Procedures

### Some Terminology

1. *Integer*: a signed whole number, i.e. zero, positive or negative whole number. E.g. 0, -1 and 7 are integers; 4/3 and 1/2 are not integers.
2. *Signed Number*: a custom name for integers and other numbers which have a decimal expansion. Basically refers to all numbers
studied in pre-algebra and early algebra.

### Addition and Subtraction

Given an addition or subtraction problem involving signed numbers (like 3 + -2, -2 &minus; 5), first ensure that the second operand is not negative by using the following:

1. a + -b = a &minus; b ; E.g. 3 + -2 = 3 - 2 ; -10 + -3 = -10 &minus; 3
1. a &minus; -b = a + b ; E.g. 3 &minus; -2 = 3 + 2 ; -6 &minus; -4 = -6 + 4

After that finish the calculation by employing the number line in the following way:

1. Start from zero, and locate the first operand on the number line to the left or right of zero depending on whether it is negative or positive respectively. Note this as an initial movement to the left or right.
1. Next, interpret an addition as a movement to the right and interpret a subtraction as a movement to the left.
2. Then if the initial movement and the movement suggested by the operation agree, add the magnitudes of the operands. The sign of the answer will be obvious from where the initial movement landed.
3. Else subtract the smaller magnitude from the larger magnitude. If the second movement is big enough to fully reverse the initial movement, then the sign of the answer will be the opposite of the destination of the initial movement.
Else the sign of the answer will be where the initial movement landed.

Examples:

1. -2 &minus; 5 = -7 ; -10 + -3 = -10 &minus; 3 = -13 ; -3/4 &minus; 1/4 = -1 ; In these cases first operand is negative, minus positive number. So the magnitude of the answer will be the sum of the magnitudes of the operands; and the answer will be negative.
2. 3 &minus; -2 = 3 + 2 = 5 ; 3/4 + 1/4 = 1; Here the first operand is positive, plus positive number. So the magnitude of the answer will be the sum of the magnitudes of the operands; and the answer will be positive.
3. -3 + 2 = -1 ; -2 + 3 = 1 ; -6 &minus; -4 = -6 + 4 = -2 ; -3/4 + 1/4 = -1/2; -1/4 + 3/4 = 1/2; In these cases the first operand is negative, plus positive number. So the magnitude of the answer will be the larger magnitude minus the smaller magnitude;
and the sign of the answer will be the sign of the operand with the larger magnitude.
4. 3 &minus; 2 = 1 ; 1 &minus; 4 = -3 ; 3 + -2 = 3 &minus; 2 = 1 ; 2 + -3 = 2 &minus; 3 = -1 ; 3/4 &minus; 1/4 = 1/2; 1/4 &minus; 3/4 = -1/2; In these cases the first operand is positive, minus positive number. Therefore the magnitude of the answer will be the larger magnitude minus the smaller magnitude.
If the first operand has the larger magnitude, then its sign will be the sign of the answer. Else the sign of the answer will be the opposite of the sign of the first operand. 

### Comparison

Procedure:

1. Positive numbers and zero are considered larger than negative numbers.
2. A negative number is considered larger than another negative number if it has a *smaller* magnitude than the other negative number.
So even though 2 < 3, -2 > -3.

Explanation of procedure:
- To compare any numbers say a and b, we compute a &minus; b and check the sign of the result.
- If the sign is positive, then a > b (a is greater than b).
- If the sign is negative, then a < b (a is less than b).
- If the subtraction result was zero, then a = b

Examples:

1. 10 > 5, 5 < 10, 4 > 0, 0 < 4
2. 5 > -10, because 5 &minus; -10 = 5 + 10, 15 which is positive ; -10 < 5, because -10 - 5 = -15 which is negative.
3. 0 > -4, because 0 &minus; -4 = 0 + 4 = 4 ; -4 < 0, because -4 &minus; 0 = -4 which is negative 
4. -5 > -10, because -5 &minus; -10 = -5 + 10 = 5 which is positive; -10 < -5, because -10 &minus; -5 = -10 + 5 = -5 which is negative
          
### Multiplication and Division

1. -a &times; -b = a &times; b ; E.g. -2 &times; -3 = 6
1. -a &div; -b = a &div; b ; E.g. -10 &div; -2 = 5
2. -a &times; b = -(a &times; b) ; E.g. -2 &times; 3 = -6
2. -a &div; b = -(a &div; b) ; E.g. -10 &div; 2 = -5
3. a &times; -b = -(a &times; b) ; E.g. 2 &times; -3 = -6
3. a &div; -b = -(a &div; b) ; E.g. 10 &div; -2 = -5

### Negation
          
1. -(a) = -1 &times; a = -a ; E.g. -(2) = -2 ; -(0) = 0
2. -(-a) = -1 &times; -a = a ; E.g. -(-2) = 2 ; ---2 = -(-(-2)) = -2



## Fraction Procedures

### Some Terminology

1. *Proper fraction*: a fraction in which the numerator is smaller than the denominator. E.g. 1/2, 1/3, 2/3
2. *Improper fraction*: a fraction in which the numerator is bigger than the denominator. E.g. 3/2, 4/3, 5/3
3. *Simple fraction*: a proper or improper fraction in which the numerator and denominator are whole numbers. E.g. 1/2 is a simple fraction, 1/(3/2) and (2/3)/5 are not simple fractions.
3. *Mixed fraction*: a fraction which is expressed in terms of a whole number part and a proper fraction part. E.g. 2 1/2, 5 3/4
4. *Ratio*: an expression involving positive numbers used to determine how to share a nonnegative number among two or more entities through repeated subtractions.
*A ratio of two positive numbers is defined in mathematics as being equivalent to a fraction*.
   - A ratio for sharing between two entities is expressed as a &ratio; b (read as "a is to b")
   - E.g. Kofi and Kwame share a collection of 100 pencils in the ratio of 2 &ratio; 3 (read as "2 is to 3"), means that
    for every 2 pencils that Kofi takes out of the collection, Kwame gets to take 3 pencils.
   - Similarly a ratio for sharing among 3 entities is expressed as a &ratio; b &ratio; c (read as "a is to b is to c").
   - E.g. Ama, Yaa and Akos share a collection of 24 canned drinks in the ratio 2 &ratio; 3 &ratio; 1 (reas as "2 is to 3 is to 1"), means that
    for every 2 cans that Ama takes out of the collection, Yaa gets to take 3 cans and Akos gets to take 1 can.
5. *of* operator: a/b of c/d = a &times; (c/d &div; b). *The *of* operator is equivalent to multiplication of fractions in mathematics.* E.g.
   - 3 of 4 = 4 + 4 + 4 = 12 ; 4 of 3 = 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 12
   - 4 of 1/2 = 1/2 + 1/2 + 1/2 + 1/2 = 2
   - 1/2 of 4 = 4/2 = 2 ; 1/3 of 5 = 5/3
   - 2/3 of 6 = 2 &times; (6/3) = 2 &times; 2 = 4 ; 3/5 of 7/10 = 3 &times; (7/10 &div; 5) = 3 &times; 7/50 = 21/50
6. *Cross multiplication*: given two fractions a/b and c/d, cross multiplication refers to the action of multiplying
a by d, and separately multiplying b by c to obtain two products (a &times; d) and (b &times; c). Cross multiplication is a heavily used step
in fraction arithmetic.

### Addition and Subtraction

Procedures:

1. a/b + c/d = (a &times; d + b &times; c)/(b &times; d)
1. a/b &minus; c/d = (a &times; d &minus; b &times; c)/(b &times; d)
1. If the denominators are the same, then the formulas simplify to become:
    1. a/e + c/e = (a + c)/e
    2. a/e &minus; c/e = (a &minus; c)/e

Explanation of Procedures:

1. To add or subtract fractions, get the denominators to be the same, and then add or subtract the numerators.
2. So in general when denominators are not the same, cross multiplication technique is used to make the denominators the same.
3. So a/b &plusmn; c/d = (a &times; d)/(b &times; d) &plusmn; (b &times; c)/(b &times; d) = (a &times; d &plusmn; b &times; c)/(b &times; d)

Examples:

1. Same denominators:
   - 3/4 + 1/4 = (3 + 1)/4 = 4/4 = 1
   - -3/4 + 1/4 = (-3 + 1)/4 = -2/4 = -1/2
   - 3/4 - 1/4 = (3 - 1)/4 = 2/4 = 1/2
3. Different denominators: *Use cross multiply*.
   - 5/4 + 3/5 = (5 &times; 5 + 4 &times; 3)/(4 &times; 5) = (25 + 12)/20 = 37/20
   - 3/2 - 5/4 = (3 &times; 4 - 2 &times; 5)/(2 &times; 4) = (12 - 10)/8 = 2/8 = 1/4
   - -3/2 - 5/4 = (-3 &times; 4 - 2 &times; 5)/(2 &times; 4) = (-12 - 10)/8 = -22/8 = -11/4

### Comparison

Procedure: To compare a/b and c/d to see which is larger,
ensure denominators b and d are positive (by multiplying fractions by -1 if necessary),
and then compare (a &times; d) and (b &times; c) to see which is larger

Explanation of Procedure:

1. As is the case for all numbers, to compare a/b and c/d, compute a/b &minus; c/d and check the sign by comparing with zero.
2. The general result for subtraction gives (a &times; d &minus; b &times; c)/(b &times; d)
3. After ensuring b and d are positive, and because the subtraction result is being compared with zero,
the sign of the subtraction result can be completely determined by the sign of the numerator alone: (a &times; d &minus; b &times; c).
4. And since that numerator is a subtraction expression, we can interpret it as a comparison between (a &times; d) and (b &times; c)

Examples: *Use cross multiply*.

   - 3/4 vrs 2/3, which is larger? Equivalent to (3 &times; 3) vrs (4 &times; 2), which is larger? Equivalent to 9 vrs 8, which is larger? And so since 9 > 8, 3/4 > 2/3
   - 2/4 vrs 1/2, which is larger? Equivalent to (2 &times; 2) vrs (4 &times; 1), which is larger? Equivalent to 4 vrs 4, which is larger? And so since 4 = 4, 2/4 = 1/2
   - 1/4 vrs 2/7, which is larger? Equivalent to (1 &times; 7) vrs (4 &times; 2), which is larger? Equivalent to 7 vrs 8, which is larger? And so since 7 < 8, 1/4 < 2/7
   - -11/4 vrs -20/7, which is larger? Equivalent to (-11 &times; 7) vrs (4 &times; -20), which is larger? Equivalent to -77 vrs -80, which is larger? And so since -77 > -80, -11/4 > -20/7
   - 11/-4 vrs 20/7, which is larger? First ensure denominators are all positive by multiplying top and down of 11/-4 by -1 to get -11/4.
   So now it is -11/4 vrs 20/7. Equivalent to (-11 &times; 7) vrs (4 &times; 20), which is larger? Equivalent to -77 vrs 80, which is larger? And so since -77 < 80, 11/-4 < 20/7.
   Alternatively, comparison test could have been made quicker by observing that 11/-4 is a negative number and 20/7 is a positive number. So since all negative numbers are considered less
   than positive numbers, 11/-4 < 20/7.

### Multiplication
          
Procedure:

1. a/b &times; c/d = (a &times; c)/(b &times; d)
2. a/b of c/d = a/b &times; c/d

Explanation of Procedure:

1. Multiplication of fractions a/b and c/d is defined as solving the following problem:
find a fraction x such that x &ratio; c/d = a &ratio; b, and x &ratio; a/b = c &ratio; d
1. And the solution, which is a result of how division of fractions is defined, is x = (a &times; c)/(b &times; d)
2. It happens that (a &times; c)/(b &times; d) = a &times; (c/d &div; b), which is the definition of a/b of c/d
3. Hence a/b of c/d = a/b &times; c/d = (a &times; c)/(b &times; d)

Examples:
   - 3/5 of 7/5 = (3 &times; 7)/(5 &times; 5) = 21/25
   - 5/4 of 3/15 = (5 &times; 3)/(4 &times; 15) = 1/4
   - 5/4 &times; -3/5 = (5 &times; -3)/(4 &times; 5) = -15/20 = -3/4
   - 5/4 &times; -3 = 5/4 &times; -3/1 = (5 &times; -3)/(4 &times; 1) = -15/4
   - 7 &times; 2/3 = 7/1 &times; 2/3 = (7 &times; 2)/(1 &times; 3) = 14/3

### Division

Procedure:

1. a/b &div; c/d = (a &times; d)/(b &times; c)
1. If the denominators are the same, then the formula simplifies to become: a/e &div; c/e = a/c

Explanation of Procedure:

1. Division of fractions takes advantage of the fact that a positive fraction is equivalent to a ratio between the numerator and the denominator
2. Division of fractions (whether simple or non-simple) is defined as being equivalent to creating a ratio from the operands, even if the operands are fractions or negative.
3. So a/b &div; c/d = a/b &ratio; c/d
2. Multiplying through the ratio by b results in: a &ratio; b &times; c/d
2. Multiplying through the ratio by d results in: a &times; d &ratio; b &times; c
3. Converting the ratio back to fraction yields: (a &times; d) &ratio; (b &times; c) = (a &times; d)/(b &times; c)
3. If there are non-simple fractions involved, then the multiplications in the formula will involve divisions, which can in turn lead to
multiplication of fractions and a cycle of performing multiplications and divisions of fractions will occur. However the cycle will end
because the fractions in each step will be decreasing in complexity, until simple fractions are encountered, or until the following are encountered:
   - having a multiplication in which there is a whole number operand. Cycle ends since multiplication of whole numbers (by repeated addition) can then be used.
   - having a division in which the second operand is a whole number. Cycle ends since multiplication (to get equivalent fraction) and division of whole numbers can then be used.

Examples:

1. Same denominators:
   - 4/5 &div; 3/5 = 4/3
2. Different denominators: *Use cross multiply*.
   - 4/5 &div; 3/15 = (4 &times; 15)/(5 &times; 3) = 60/15 = 4
   - -4/5 &div; -3/4 = (-4 &times; 4)/(5 &times; -3) = -16/-15 = 16/15
