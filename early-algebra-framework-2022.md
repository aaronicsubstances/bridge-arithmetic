# Early Algebra Framework 2022

## Literature Review on Early Algebra

Kieran (2004) framework for early algebraic thinking will be adopted to serve as the foundation of any early algebra curriculum.

Would like to extend the early algebra framework in Kieran (2004), based the history of a few important milestones in the development of algebra, notably symbolic algebra, abstract algebra, and functions by arguing that:
  - generational activities include interpreting standard mathematical notation.
  - global/meta-level activities include function application and equation solving.
  - despite the fuzzy boundary between arithmetic and algebra, the manipulation of placeholders for unknown real numbers as if they are known counting numbers, aka simplification of algebraic expressions, is definitely beyond the scope of arithmetic and early algebra.

Hewitt's framework of subordination (1996) and his follow-up articles on "arbitrary vs necessary" divide in mathematics, will also be adopted to guide the design of any early algebra curriculum.

## Proposed Goals of Early Algebra Education

   1. To build the confidence of students for algebra study.

   2. To introduce students to the generational activities of algebra by introducing them to the standard mathematical notation.

   3. To give the student a firm understanding of the following subset of the properties of counting numbers such that, the student will more easily understand the rules used in the transformational activities of algebra:
       1. Addition
       2. Subtraction as undoing addition in general.
       3. Multiplication as repeated addition, which also holds when there is a counting number involved to serve as a multiplier.
       4. Division as repeated subtraction and possibly leaving a remainder; in general, undoing multiplication without leaving a remainder.
       5. Justification for cancelling out (or multiplying top and down): if *d* divides *a* to get *m*, then *cd* divides *ca* to get *m* as well for any counting number *c*, and conversely.
       6. Trichotomy law of counting numbers: given any two counting numbers *a* and *b*, either *a* = *b*, *a* < *b* or *a* > *b*. Also, *a* < *b* means that b&minus;a is a counting number; *a* > *b* means that a&minus;b is a counting number; and a = b means that a&minus;b is less than any counting number.
       7. Equation invariance: same operation done to LHS and RHS maintains equality.
       8. Commutativity of addition and multiplication
       9. Associativity of addition and multiplication
       10. Distributivity of multiplication over addition
   
   4. To make the student familiar with the following subset of the global activities of algebra:
       1. problem solving (like in Polya's How to Solve It book), including the method of trial and error and the habit of cross checking answers.
       2. generalizing (like in Mason's 2006 book).
       3. noticing structure (like in Kieran's 2018 article)
       4. function application
       5. equation solving, with guess and check as the main solution method.

   5. To make students proficient in arithmetic.

   6. To engage students in curricular activities which connect fractions and negative numbers to real life scenarios of students.


## Assumptions of Early Algebra Proposal

  1. A disconnect exists between novices and experts with regards to the appreciation of mathematics.
     - Mathematics novices see some of the arithmetic operations (such as multiplication and division of negative numbers) as not having practical use.
     - Standard mathemtical notation was not designed with consideration for mathematics novices.

  2. The concept of function is the long sought after meeting point of meaning of algebraic expressions between mathematicians and mathematics novices.
     - With function concept, mathematicians do not have to force or shame mathematics novices into seeing the "sense" or "meaning" in arithmetic operations. Mathematics novices can simply see the arithmetic operations as mapping input numbers to an output number. 

  3. The history of mathematics development up to symbolic algebra was not an accident, but an indication of how the human mind newly introduced to mathematics works its way up to acquire the mathematical concepts.
     - Empathy may then be required on the part of teachers regarding any resistance from students in the acceptance of certain real numbers: zero (ie nothing), one (ie not many), fractions, improper fractions, irrational numbers, negative numbers.

  4. Absence of computers and technology.

  4. Set of real numbers is practically equal to set of rational numbers.

  5. Word problems seem to require familiarity with similar types in the past. Even we advanced mathematicians still get tripped up by completely new word problems (e.g. in "The Algebra of Mohammed Ben Musa"). As such, we can be gracious to ourselves and to our students in understanding our difficulties in word problems.
     - Therefore, we can assume that the practical solution to word problems is familiarity with past questions, and lack of caprice on the part of examination question creators.
     - We should not expect students to be able to solve any arbitrary word problem just because its solution eventually employs techniques familiar to the student.

  6. Mastery of mathematics requires working out lots of examples and exercises. Therefore
     - The primary school student who rarely works on mathematics risks struggling in the subject later on, no matter how good his/her grades currently are.
     - If the student is not prepared to spend some extra time on mathematics compared to subjects which can be "verified easily from the natural world", then he/she will sabotage his progress in mathematics.

  7. Common algebra misconceptions (such as subtraction wrongly seen as absolute difference, or BODMAS applied out of context) arise when students are not exposed to sufficient variety of examples and exercises
     - Therefore students should be shown examples and exercises for which no or only inferior solutions exist prior to algebra study, to counteract the growth of algebra misconceptions.
