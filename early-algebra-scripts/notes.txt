operations
 - addition
 - subtraction
 - multiplication
 = division
 - comparison
 - modulo
 
The following operations can be expressed in terms of those indicated above:
 - integer division
 - square
 - cube
 - negation
 
NB: modulo and integer division will be combined in questions as "perform division and give me the quotient and the remainder".
 
The following takes expression as their single argument, which will usually be restricted to single operand or single operation from above list
 - magnitude
 - sign - or simply "is it negative or not"?

Operand range (numer_start, numer_end, denom_start, denom_end)
 - start and end of range are inclusive
 - for each operand or both operands
 - skipFractionSimplification


options for presenting numbers serving as operands or answers
 - fraction (options: mixed or not)
 - decimal expansion presentation of operands
 

Result range:
 - subtraction: unrestricted, nonnegative only, positive only
 - division: unrestricted, cannot be undefined, terminating decimal only, integer only
 - modulo: unrestricted, no remainder




-May have to be more intentional about single-digit multiplication tables, in order to cover everything.

options for accepting numbers serving as response to questions:
 - unrestricted
 - fraction only (mixed or common or either)
 - decimal only

question
-number class - C, W, Q-Q-, Q

aside add, sub, multiply, divide, negate, square, cube
also add
-add and multiply with more than 2 args.
-integer division with remainder: generates two answers.
-comparison
 -which is greater
 -have is answer positive or negative or zero questions, and apply to addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, probably all operations
 -have questions comparing magnitude of result to that of operands. e.g. 3 * 7? definitely larger than 3, definitely smaller than 3, definitely larger than 7, definitely smaller than 3, definitely smaller than 3 and 7, definitely larger than 3 and 7. 

have a timer which sounds exponentially, every 10 or so mins. or can be set by user.

so just a static 2-level hieerarchical list of tests with a rubric explaining what each topmost section is about.
-each test begins with a rubric explaining how many times it should be taken, and what problems it helps to solve, and who needs it.
-each test ends with a score, and a rubric explaining how to interpret score or scores including previous ones. and can include recommendations as to where next to go.


action plan for fiverr
-get someone to generate reactjs website with arithmetic (will have to determine how to randomly generate arithmetic questions)
-get someone to solve aki-ola jhs questions (will have to determine which ones are algebra-related and scan them for online typists)
-get someone to type selected algebraic equations into mathml (assuming mathtype is used) in pairs of question and solution.
-get someone to generate reactjs website with solved questions in section B format
-(will have to determine section A's questions and possible answers and get someone to type them in mathml, asciimath or tex and insert into website).
-(may still have to generate some section B questions by hand, with answers, and get someone to type them into MathML and insert into website)
