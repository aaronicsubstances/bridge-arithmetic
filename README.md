# Early Algebra Curriculum Proposal

## Operational Definition of Early Algebra

Early algebra is a subset of topics in both arithmetic and algebra, which should be taught during the study of arithmetic, and definitely before the study of simplification of algebraic expressions, in order to better ensure success in the study of algebra in secondary school.

## Guidelines

  - Due to lack of experimental validation by the proponents of this proposal, only existing primary school and secondary school topics are included.
  - The decision to introduce alternatives to the standard algorithms which differ from what teachers expect of students in a given locality, and which will show up on answer sheets is beyond the scope of this early algebra proposal.
  - Early algebra can consist of curricular activities that are done outside of answer sheets, such as calculations done with abacus, as long as those activities are connected to the standard algorithms and can help to visualize the algorithms on answer sheets.
  - The arithmetic portion of early algebra consists of
     - demarcating arithmetic topics whose study may be postponed until early algebra study is complete.
     - curricular activities involving touch and movement, and demonstrating the standard algorithms for addition, subtraction, multiplication and integer division for counting numbers.

## Arithmetic Activities

The following activities are meant for rational numbers:
  - Addition
  - Subtraction
  - Multiplication
  - Division
  - Comparison 
     - includes predicting whether result of an arithmetic operation is negative or not
     - includes predicting the result of comparing magnitudes of operands with magnitude of result of an arithmetic operation.
  - Conversion of fractions from and to decimal expansions
  - Developing proficiency in arithmetic of single digit whole numbers
  - Developing proficiency in simplification of fractions using divisibility rules

If necessary, can reduce the activities above by excluding long division and negative number arithmetic, to obtain the following:
  - Addition of nonnegative rational numbers
  - Subtraction of nonnegative rational numbers (negative results may be permitted).
  - Multiplication of whole numbers
  - Division of whole numbers by trial and error instead of long division
     - ie keep multiplying divisor by educated guesses, until a guess is found which gives a remainder less than the divisor.
  - Comparison of nonnegative rational numbers
  - Conversion of nonnegative fractions from and to terminating decimal expansions by multiplication instead of long division
     - ie keep multiplying top and down by 2 or 5 if denominator is not a power of 10 and its last non-zero digit is 5 or 2 respectively, until denominator becomes a power of 10 to lead to the desired terminating decimal expansion, or until last non-zero digit in denominator is neither 2 or 5 to indicate that decimal expansion will not terminate.
  - Developing proficiency in arithmetic of single digit whole numbers
  - Developing proficiency in simplification of nonnegative fractions using divisibility rules

## Algebra Activities

Each algebra activity to be listed here can be characterized by
  - whether or not it is a word problem
  - whether or not it supplies multiple choices out of which correct answer must be chosen.
  - the kind of response or result expected: a rational number, an expression or an equation.

Algebra activities which are identified as useful for early algebra education are:

  - expression evaluation (aka "substitution") involving only the four basic arithmetic operators (+, -, &#x00D7;, &#x00F7;)
     - includes focus on drilling in convention of concatenation for multiplication 
     - NB: substitution exercises in popular math text books can also get us equation solving activities using guess and check (with possible answers of objective tests as guesses)
  - expression evaluation involving functions with verbose names which map to the four basic arithmetic operators, squares and cubes.
  - expression evaluation involving powers, roots, exponents and logarithmic (common and natural log) and trigonometry (sin, cos and tan) functions
  - equation solving, mainly linear equations
     - includes univariate polynomial equations, and simultaneous equations in multiple variables
     - with guess and check strategy included (using possible answers of objective tests as guesses, can have a "None of the above" choice included)
     - NB: equation solving exercises in popular math text books can also get us expression evaluation activities
  - equation/expression generation
     - e.g. express y in terms of x if y = final expr in terms of intermediate variables, and
     expressions for intermediate variables in terms of x are given.
     - NB: shares some similarities with parametric equations 
     - NB: can get exercises from expression evaluation exercises, by identifying the last operation, identifying the operands involved as intermediate variables, expressing y in terms of the last operation identified
     and the intermediate variables, and finally asking for the expression in the evaluation exercise.
  - equation/expression decomposition - reverse of expression/equation generation:
     - e.g. if y = final expr in terms of x, and given definitions of intermediate variables, and multiple choices of y in terms of the intermediate variables, pick the correct choice of y.
     - e.g. if y = final expr in terms of x, and without definitions of intermediate variables, but given multiple choices of y in terms of intermediate variables (ie y = a + b + c + d, or y = a * b, or y = subtraction(a, b), or y = log(a)), pick correct choice of y, and identify intermediate variables a, b, c and d in terms of x.
     - NB: the rationale for the existence of this exercise is that, in practice during algebraic expression simplification and equation solving, identifying the last (or "root") step rather than the first step (as suggested by BODMAS) is more important for flexibility in breaking down expressions, and even evaluating multiple parts concurrently.
  - math applications to real world of student
     - aka "word problems"

The early algebra activities identified address the following needs as well:
  - questions requiring knowledge of commuativity of addition but not subtraction - using ordinary subtraction questions and accepting "not defined" (similar to dividing by zero) or "negative" or negative sign as valid answer.
  - questions requiring knowledge of associativity of addition but not subtraction - using expression evaluation.
  - questions requiring knowledge of distributivity of multiplication over addition - using multiplication questions and demonstrating how any multiplication algorithm is an application of the distributivity property, because it leverages memory of tables to reduce the number of repeated additions suggested by the involvement of a counting number multiplier.
