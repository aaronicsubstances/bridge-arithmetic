# Early Algebra Curriculum Proposal

## What is Early Algebra?

Early algebra refers to the subset of arithmetic and algebra topics taught in primary and secondary schools, which excludes the topic of simplification of algebraic expressions and other susbsequent topics. For pre-teens or students in primary school, the topic of arithmetic of whole numbers is excluded as well.

These are the early algebra topics for pre-teens:

- Arithmetic of non-whole numbers. This includes arithmetic involving zero, and also arithmetic yielding non-whole number results even if the operands were all whole numbers.
- Powers and Roots
- Evaluation of arithmetic expressions
- Equation solving by guess and check

For teens and adults, this proposal permits the introduction of less optimal but more intuitive arithmetic procedures to the students. It also permits the presentation of the early algebra topics in a different arrangement from that for pre-teens, in order to better suit the challenges and opportunities presented by teens and adults.

## Goals

The goal of early algebra for students is proficiency in evaluation of arithmetic expressions involving rational numbers.

For students who are teens or adults, there is an additional goal which is to be able to practice and become proficient in early algebra alone, with almost no supervision.

## Guidelines

- Due to lack of experimental validation by the proponents of this proposal, only existing primary school and secondary school topics are included.
- The proposal recognizes that it is school authorities who have the final decision to allow alternatives to the standard procedures, which differ from what teachers expect of students in a given locality, to show up on answer sheets.

## Arithmetic Topics

The following activities are assumed to constitute arithmetic for rational numbers as taught in school or online (e.g. https://www.transum.org):

- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division
- Powers and Roots
- Comparison
- Conversion of fractions from and to decimal expansions
- Conversion of fractions and decimal expansions to rounded decimal expansions
- Developing proficiency in arithmetic of whole numbers
- Developing proficiency in simplification of fractions

The arithmetic parts of early algebra proposal for adults seek to leverage memorization to quickly increase confidence in the study of arithmetic. For this reason the arithmetic parts is recorded in the form of tables, worked examples, formulas, demonstrations of arithmetic procedures, multi-choice questions, and exercises with detailed solutions. Some of these parts are as follows:

### Rational Number Categorizations

Early algebra proposal for adults depends on using formulas to perform arithmetic operations whenever possible. And these formulas depend on the perspective taken of the operands involved. Therefore the proposal requires making students aware that

- numbers come in kinds or types, i.e. whole numbers, non-whole numbers.
- numbers have parts or perspectives, i.e. sign, magnitude, numerator, denominator.
- numbers can be presented in different formats, i.e. common fraction, mixed fraction, decimal expansion, standard form.

### Alternative Arithmetic Procedures

- Subtraction of whole numbers
  - subtraction by solving addition equation by guess and check of digits.
- Multiplication of whole numbers
  - multiplication by grid method (aka grid multiplication).
- Division of whole numbers
  - by trial and error: keep multiplying divisor by educated guesses, until a guess is found which gives a nonnegative remainder less than the divisor.
    One benefit of being aware of this procedure is that, it is always present as a step in the other more efficient procedures for division.
  - division by chunking (aka division by partial quotients method).
- Conversion of fractions to exact or rounded decimal expansions without long division. The procedure works this way:
  - begin by using division by chunking to obtain an initial whole number and remainder. The initial whole number will form the initial digits of the decimal expansion.
  - if remainder is nonzero, multiply the whole number and remainder by 10, perform division by chunking on the remainder. Add the resulting whole number to the current digits of the decimal expansion by addition. Also take note of the number of times multiplication by 10 is being performed.
  - repeat previous step until either remainder becomes zero, the desired number of digits in the decimal expansion is obtained (in the case of rounding), or the digits in the decimal expansion repeat (in the case of finding exact non-terminating decimal expansions).
  - the final answer results from dividing the decimal expansion obtained by a power of 10 whose zero count equals the number of multiplications by 10 made.

## Algebra Topics

Algebra parts of early algebra proposal are arithmetic expression evaluation and equation solving by guess and check.

- expression evaluation (aka "substitution") involving only the four basic arithmetic operations
  - includes drilling in convention of concatenation for multiplication
  - can include powers, roots, trigonometry, logarithms, and factorial
- equation solving with guess and check involving mainly linear equations
  - can include univariate polynomial equations, and simultaneous equations in multiple variables
