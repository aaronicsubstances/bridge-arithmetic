# Early Algebra Curriculum Proposal

## Operational Definition of Early Algebra

Early algebra is a subset of topics in both arithmetic and algebra, which should be taught during the study of arithmetic, and definitely before the study of simplification of algebraic expressions, in order to better ensure success in the study of algebra in secondary school.

## Guidelines

- Due to lack of experimental validation by the proponents of this proposal, only existing primary school and secondary school topics are included.
- The proposal recognizes that it is school authorities who have the final decision to allow alternatives to the standard algorithms which differ from what teachers expect of students in a given locality, and which will show up on answer sheets.
- The arithmetic portion of the early algebra proposal consists of emphasis on
  - sequencing arithmetic topics and designing exercises in such a way that a teenager can teach himself, without having to expose his embarassments and failures in math.
  - addition algorithm
  - multiplication tables
  - providing intuitive alternatives to applications of long division algorithm for as long as possible
  - proficiency in arithmetic calculations, even if it means introducing non-standard arithmetic algorithms to the student.
  - providing multiple choice questions and questions with full or partial answers, to provide the kind of feedback which helps with self-learning
  - exposing students to exercises for which no solutions exist at the moment, to counteract development of misconceptions in algebra later on
  - exposing students to exercises for which only inferior solutions exist at the moment, to serve as cross checking avenues in algebra later on

## Arithmetic Activities

The following activities are meant for rational numbers:

- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division
- Comparison
  - includes predicting whether result of an arithmetic operation is negative or not
  - includes predicting the result of comparing magnitudes of operands with magnitude of result of an arithmetic operation.
- Conversion of fractions from and to decimal expansions
- Conversion of fractions and decimal expansions to rounded decimal expansions
- Developing proficiency in arithmetic of single digit whole numbers
- Developing proficiency in simplification of fractions using divisibility rules

If necessary, can start with a reduction of the activities above by excluding long division and negative number arithmetic, to obtain the following:

- Addition of nonnegative rational numbers
- Subtraction of nonnegative rational numbers (negative results may be permitted).
  - if permitted by school authorities, adopt the more intuitive algorithm of subtraction by solving addition equation.
- Multiplication of whole numbers
  - if permitted by school authorities, adopt the more intuitive algorithm of multiplication by grid method (aka grid multiplication).
- Division of whole numbers by algorithms other than long division which are more intutive, because they perform the division by directly solving
  the division algorithm equation.
  - by trial and error: keep multiplying divisor by educated guesses, until a guess is found which gives a nonnegative remainder less than the divisor. One benefit of being aware of this algorithm is that, it is always present as a step in the other more efficient algorithms for division.
  - if permitted by school authorities, adopt the more efficient approach of division by chunking (aka division by partial quotients method).
- Comparison of nonnegative rational numbers
- Conversion of nonnegative fractions from and to terminating decimal expansions by multiplication instead of long division
  - ie keep multiplying top and down by 2 or 5 if denominator is not a power of 10 and its last non-zero digit is 5 or even number respectively, until denominator becomes a power of 10 to lead to the desired terminating decimal expansion, or until last non-zero digit in denominator is neither even number nor 5 to indicate that decimal expansion will not terminate.
- Conversion of terminating decimal expansions to rounded decimal expansions
- Conversion of fractions to rounded decimal expansions without long division
  - ie given a number of decimal places to round to, say 3 decimal places, multiply the fraction by a multiple of 10 which is 1 followed by at least 3 zeros (e.g. 1000), and then convert to mixed fraction. Divide the whole number part of the mixed fraction by the multiple of 10 used (1000 in this example), and then determine the digits making up the rounded decimal expansion.
    Finally, if some of the digits of the whole number part are absent in the rounded decimal expansion, then discard the fractional part and be done (actually fractional part can always be discarded if the number of zeros in the multiple used exceeds the desired number of decimal places. e.g. if 10,000 was used instead of 1,000).
    Else use the fractional part to determine whether to add a 1 to the last digit of the whole number part in the rounded decimal expansion, depending on
    whether it is greater than or equal to 1/2.
- Developing proficiency in arithmetic of single digit whole numbers
- Developing proficiency in simplification of nonnegative fractions using divisibility rules

## Algebra Activities

Each algebra activity to be listed here can be characterized by

- whether or not it is a word problem
- whether or not it supplies multiple choices out of which correct answer must be chosen.
- the kind of response or result expected: a rational number, an expression or an equation.

Algebra activities which are identified as useful for early algebra education are:

- expression evaluation (aka "substitution") involving only the four basic arithmetic operators (+, -, &#x00D7;, &#x00F7;)
  - includes focus on drilling in convention of concatenation for multiplication
  - NB: substitution exercises in popular math text books can also get us equation solving activities using guess and check (with possible answers of objective tests as guesses)
- expression evaluation involving functions with verbose names which map to the four basic arithmetic operators, squares and cubes.
- expression evaluation involving powers, roots, exponents and logarithmic (common and natural log) and trigonometry (sin, cos and tan) functions
- equation solving, mainly linear equations
  - includes univariate polynomial equations, and simultaneous equations in multiple variables
  - with guess and check strategy included (using possible answers of objective tests as guesses, can have a "None of the above" choice included)
  - NB: equation solving exercises in popular math text books can also get us expression evaluation activities
- equation/expression generation
  - Can get exercises from expression evaluation exercises, by putting forward the expression evaluation steps (each involving just one operation at a time) as the question, and asking for the expression itself from multiple choices. Can remove need to employ intermediate variables by ensuring that the expression arguments and intermediate results are unique.
- equation/expression decomposition
  - Can get exercises from expression evaluation exercises, by putting forward the expression as the question, and putting forward choices in which each is a last operation equals a final answer, and then asking for the correct choice. Can make the expression complex if there's only one choice with the correct last operation. And can include multiple correct last operations and multiple correct final answers if the last operation can be in multiple positions of addition, subtraction or multiplication.
  - NB: the rationale for the existence of this exercise is that, in practice during algebraic expression simplification and equation solving, identifying the last (or "root") step rather than the first step (as suggested by BODMAS) is more important for flexibility in breaking down expressions, and even evaluating multiple parts concurrently.

  - aka "word problems"

The early algebra activities identified address the following needs as well:

- questions requiring knowledge of commutativity of addition but not subtraction - using ordinary subtraction questions and accepting "undefined" (similar to dividing by zero), "unexpected number", "negative", or negative sign as valid answers.
- questions requiring knowledge of associativity of addition but not subtraction - using expression evaluation.
- questions requiring knowledge of distributivity of multiplication over addition - using multiplication questions and demonstrating how any multiplication algorithm is an application of the distributivity property, because it leverages memory of tables to reduce the number of repeated additions suggested by the involvement of a counting number multiplier.
