# Early Algebra Highlighting Proposal

## What is Early Algebra?

Early algebra refers to arithmetic and the subset of algebra topics taught in primary and secondary schools. It excludes the topics of simplification of algebraic expressions and other susbsequent topics in algebra. For pre-teens or students in primary school, the curriculum activities of arithmetic of small whole numbers by means other than applying procedures (e.g. by manual counting) are excluded as well.

These are the early algebra topics for pre-teens:

- Arithmetic, especially of large whole numbes and of non-whole numbers.
- Powers and Roots
- Evaluation of algebraic expressions
- Equation solving by guess and check

For teens and adults, this proposal permits the introduction of less optimal but more intuitive arithmetic procedures to the students. It also permits the presentation of the early algebra topics in a different arrangement from that for pre-teens, in order to better suit the challenges and opportunities presented by teens and adults.

## Goals

The goal of early algebra for students is proficiency in evaluation of algebraic expressions involving rational numbers.

For students who are teens or adults, there is an additional goal which is to be able to practice and become proficient in early algebra by themselves, with almost no supervision.

## Guidelines

- Due to lack of experimental validation by the proponents of this proposal, only existing primary school and secondary school topics are included.
- The proposal recognizes that it is school authorities who have the final decision to allow alternatives to the standard procedures, which differ from what teachers expect of students in a given locality, to show up on answer sheets.

## Arithmetic Topics

The following activities are assumed to constitute arithmetic for rational numbers as taught in school or online:

- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication and *of* operator
- Division and Ratios
- Powers and Roots
- Comparison and Number Line
- Conversion of fractions from and to decimal expansions
- Conversion of fractions and decimal expansions to rounded decimal expansions
- Developing proficiency in arithmetic of integers
- Developing proficiency in arithmetic of fractions and decimal expansions
- Divisibility Rules and Prime Factorization

The arithmetic parts of early algebra proposal for adults seek to leverage reference materials (capable of being memorized in school settings), to quickly increase confidence in the study of arithmetic. For this reason the arithmetic parts is recorded in the form of tables, worked examples, formulas, demonstrations of arithmetic procedures, multi-choice questions, and exercises with detailed solutions. Some of these parts are as follows:

### Rational Number Categorizations

Early algebra proposal for adults depends on using formulas to perform arithmetic operations whenever possible. And these formulas depend on the perspective taken of the operands involved. Therefore the proposal requires making students aware that

- numbers come in kinds or types, i.e. whole numbers, non-whole numbers.
- numbers have parts or perspectives, i.e. sign, magnitude, numerator, denominator.
- numbers can be presented in different formats, i.e. common fraction, mixed fraction, decimal expansion, standard form.

### Alternative Arithmetic Procedures

NB: can serve as crosschecking avenues to the ones approved in school.

- Subtraction of whole numbers
  - add crosschecking by addition to standard subtraction algorithms.
- Multiplication of whole numbers
  - multiplication by grid method (aka grid multiplication).
- Alternative to long division
  - division by chunking (aka division by partial quotients method): exact, but for whole number division only
  - rounding of fractions to given decimal place count, by multiplication with any power of 10 whose zero count equals or exceeds decimal place count, and discarding remainder: exact if zero count exceeds decimal place count; truncation instead of rounding if zero count equals decimal place count.
  - conversion of fraction to decimal, by first converting fraction to the form (A+b/d)/10^n, where A, b, d, and n are whole numbers, b/d is zero or a proper fraction (ie b is less than d). Additionally, where b is not zero, d divides a number consisting of only the digit 9 (ie has the form -1 + 10^m, m being a counting number), and the result of dividing the string of nines (usually the number 999,999) by d produces the critical decimal expansion needed to finish off the conversion.
    - use of 999,999 to recall repeating decimal expansions works for all cases in which repeating part of decimal expansion length is 1, 2, 3 or 6. And this covers all practical cases in JHS. Because within the range of numbers from 1 to 100, the primes having different lengths are those larger than or equal to 17 (all exceed 6 in length except 41 which has length of 5). And also because the composite numbers in 1 to 100 range with different lengths are odd numbers which are not multiples of 5, starting with 49 upwards (all exceed 6 in length), except 63, 77, 91 and 99.
    - technique of multiplication of purely repeating decimals corresponding to unit fractions (like 1/3 and unlike 1/6) by whole numbers, can be used recall repeating decimal expansions for other proper fractions based on the same denominator.
	- fallback to rounding to 3 decimal places if a decimal expansion cannot be recalled or computed.


## Algebra Topics

Algebra parts of early algebra proposal are algebraic expression evaluation and equation solving.

- expression evaluation (aka "substitution") mainly involving only the four basic arithmetic operations
  - includes drilling in convention of concatenation for multiplication
  - can include powers, roots, trigonometry and logarithms
- equation solving involving mainly linear equations
  - introduce guess and check as a last resort strategy
  - can include quadratic equations, and simultaneous equations in two variables
  - can introduce precursor to quadratic expression factorization and quadratic equation solving, which is finding two integers which add up to a given value, and which have another given value as their product.
